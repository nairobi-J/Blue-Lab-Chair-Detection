# Project Title: Chair Detection Model

## Overview

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to detect chairs in images. The model has been trained using a custom dataset tailored specifically for chair detection. It uses Python in a Google Colab environment, leveraging popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV for model training, image processing, and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- tensorflow
- keras
- opencv-python
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the Cells**  
   Follow the sequential steps outlined in the notebook:
   - **Dataset Preparation**: Upload your custom chair dataset or follow the instructions to access the dataset.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for training.
   - **Model Building and Training**: The chair detection model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
   - **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on test data and visualizations of the detection results are shown.

3. **Analyze the Results**  
   After running the cells, you will see evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results will also include visualizations of detected chairs in test images.

## Features

- **Custom Dataset**: The model is trained on a unique dataset specifically for chair detection, improving the accuracy for this task.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better model performance.
- **CNN Model**: The chair detection model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Visualization**: Results are displayed through visualizations such as confusion matrices and examples of detected chairs.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

## Notes

- Ensure the dataset is properly uploaded and formatted as per the specifications in the notebook.
- The model can be retrained with different data or additional image augmentation techniques for improved accuracy.
- This notebook is designed to run in the Colab environment. Running it locally might require additional setup for GPU support.
